# Analysis-of-Marriage-Dissolution-in-the-US
For this project, our group is interested in seeing how the different covariates affect the survival probability of the coupleâ€™s marriages, and we aim to examine the interactions between the covariates to see if any of these interactions are significant. Furthermore, we are also interested in seeing whether or not the covariates have differing effects on the probability of divorce depending on how long a couple has been married. We initially hypothesize that the hazard rate is high at the beginning of a marriage, and that, after a certain point in time, the hazard rate will decrease significantly. Our ultimate goal for this project is to test whether or not this hypothesis is true by using various statistical tools to successfully manipulate and analyze our data.
